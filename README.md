# CodeSamples
This is a sample of my work.


# What this repository is about
The code samples are taken from an ongoing project on evaluating the impacts of child marriage on wellbeing among adolescents in Peru, Ethiopia, India, and Vietnam in the Young Lives project.

The Young Lives project is a longitudinal dataset following around 2000 children in each country, collecting data on a variety of indicators including health, education, and labour outcomes.

This code preprocesses, conducts multiple imputation, and a number of analyses on the research question.
